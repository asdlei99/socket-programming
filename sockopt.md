|SO_KEEPALIVE|yes|yes|DWORD (boolean)|Enables keep-alive for a socket connection. Valid only for protocols that support the notion of keep-alive (connection-oriented protocols). For TCP, the default keep-alive timeout is 2 hours and the keep-alive interval is 1 second. The default number of keep-alive probes varies based on the version of Windows. See the SO_KEEPALIVE reference for more information.|
|SO_LINGER|yes|yes|struct linger|Indicates the state of the linger structure associated with a socket. If the l_onoff member of the linger structure is nonzero, a socket remains open for a specified amount of time after a closesocket function call to enable queued data to be sent. The amount of time, in seconds, to remain open is specified in the l_linger member of the linger structure. This option is only valid for reliable, connection-oriented protocols.|
|SO_MAX_MSG_SIZE|yes||DWORD|Returns the maximum outbound message size for message-oriented sockets supported by the protocol. Has no meaning for stream-oriented sockets.|
|SO_MAXDG|yes||DWORD|Returns the maximum size, in bytes, for outbound datagrams supported by the protocol. This socket option has no meaning for stream-oriented sockets.|
|SO_MAXPATHDG|yes||DWORD|Returns the maximum size, in bytes, for outbound datagrams supported by the protocol to a given destination address. This socket option has no meaning for stream-oriented sockets. Microsoft providers may silently treat this as SO_MAXDG.|
|SO_OOBINLINE|yes|yes|DWORD (boolean)|Indicates that out-of-bound data should be returned in-line with regular data. This option is only valid for connection-oriented protocols that support out-of-band data.|
|SO_OPENTYPE|yes|yes|DWORD|Once set, affects whether subsequent sockets that are created will be non-overlapped. The possible values for this option are SO_SYNCHRONOUS_ALERT and SO_SYNCHRONOUS_NONALERT. This option should not be used. Instead use the WSASocket function and leave the WSA_FLAG_OVERLAPPED bit in the dwFlags parameter turned off.|
|SO_PAUSE_ACCEPT|yes|yes|DWORD(boolean)|Use this option for listening sockets. When the option is set, the socket responds to all incoming connections with an RST rather than accepting them.|
|SO_PORT_SCALABILITY|yes|yes|DWORD (boolean)|Enables local port scalability for a socket by allowing port allocation to be maximized by allocating wildcard ports multiple times for different local address port pairs on a local machine. On platforms where both options are available, prefer SO_REUSE_UNICASTPORT instead of this option. See the SO_PORT_SCALABILITY reference for more information.|
|SO_PROTOCOL_INFO|yes||WSAPROTOCOL_INFO|This option is defined to the SO_PROTOCOL_INFOW socket option if the UNICODE macro is defined. If the UNICODE macro is not defined, then this option is defined to the SO_PROTOCOL_INFOA socket option.|
|SO_PROTOCOL_INFOA|yes||WSAPROTOCOL_INFOA|Returns the WSAPROTOCOL_INFOA structure for the given socket
|SO_PROTOCOL_INFOW|yes||WSAPROTOCOL_INFOW|Returns the WSAPROTOCOL_INFOW structure for the given socket|
|SO_RANDOMIZE_PORT|yes|yes|uint16|This option should be set on an unbound socket. When SO_RANDOMIZE_PORT is set and an ephemeral port is selected on the socket, a random port number is bound. Auto-reuse ports (ports selected using SO_REUSE_UNICASTPORT) also randomize the returned port, so if an application sets SO_REUSE_UNICASTPORT and then attempts to set SO_RANDOMIZE_PORT, the second setsockopt call fails.|
|SO_RCVBUF|yes|yes|DWORD|The total per-socket buffer space reserved for receives. This is unrelated to SO_MAX_MSG_SIZE and does not necessarily correspond to the size of the TCP receive window.|
|SO_RCVLOWAT|yes|yes|DWORD|A socket option from BSD UNIX included for backward compatibility. This option sets the minimum number of bytes to process for socket input operations. This option is not supported by the Windows TCP/IP provider. If this option is used on Windows Vista and later, the getsockopt and setsockopt functions fail with WSAEINVAL. On earlier versions of Windows, these functions fail with WSAENOPROTOOPT.|
|SO_RCVTIMEO|yes|yes|DWORD|The timeout, in milliseconds, for blocking receive calls. The default for this option is zero, which indicates that a receive operation will not time out. If a blocking receive call times out, the connection is in an indeterminate state and should be closed. If the socket is created using the WSASocket function, then the dwFlags parameter must have the WSA_FLAG_OVERLAPPED attribute set for the timeout to function properly. Otherwise the timeout never takes effect.|
|SO_REUSEADDR|yes|yes|DWORD (boolean)|Allows a socket to bind to an address and port already in use. The SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE option can prevent this.
|SO_REUSE_UNICASTPORT|yes|yes|DWORD (boolean)|When set, allow ephemeral port reuse for Winsock API connection functions which require an explicit bind, such as ConnectEx. Note that connection functions with an implicit bind (such as connect without an explicit bind) have this option set by default. Use this option instead of SO_PORT_SCALABILITY on platforms where both are available.|
|SO_REUSE_MULTICASTPORT|yes||DWORD|When set on a socket, this option indicates that the socket will never be used to receive unicast packets, and consequently that its port can be shared with other multicast-only applications. Setting the value to 1 enables always sharing multicast traffic on the port. Setting the value to 0 (default) disables this behavior.|
|SO_SNDBUF|yes|yes|DWORD|The total per-socket buffer space reserved for sends. This is unrelated to SO_MAX_MSG_SIZE and does not necessarily correspond to the size of a TCP send window.|
|SO_SNDLOWAT|yes|yes|DWORD|A socket option from BSD UNIX included for backward compatibility. This option sets the minimum number of bytes to process for socket output operations. This option is not supported by the Windows TCP/IP provider. If this option is used on Windows Vista and later, the getsockopt and setsockopt functions fail with WSAEINVAL. On earlier versions of Windows, these functions fail with WSAENOPROTOOPT.|
|SO_SNDTIMEO|yes|yes|DWORD|The timeout, in milliseconds, for blocking send calls. The default for this option is zero, which indicates that a send operation will not time out. If a blocking send call times out, the connection is in an indeterminate state and should be closed. If the socket is created using the WSASocket function, then the dwFlags parameter must have the WSA_FLAG_OVERLAPPED attribute set for the timeout to function properly. Otherwise the timeout never takes effect.|
|SO_TYPE|yes||DWORD|Returns the socket type for the given socket (SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_DGRAM, for example).|
|SO_UPDATE_ACCEPT_CONTEXT||yes|DWORD (boolean)|This option is used with the AcceptEx function. This option updates the properties of the socket which are inherited from the listening socket. This option should be set if the getpeername, getsockname, getsockopt, or setsockopt functions are to be used on the accepted socket.|
|SO_UPDATE_CONNECT_CONTEXT||yes|DWORD (boolean)|This option is used with the ConnectEx, WSAConnectByList, and WSAConnectByName functions. This option updates the properties of the socket after the connection is established. This option should be set if the getpeername, getsockname, getsockopt, setsockopt, or shutdown functions are to be used on the connected socket.|
|SO_USELOOPBACK|yes|yes|DWORD (boolean)|Use the local loopback address when sending data from this socket. This option should only be used when all data sent will also be received locally. This option is not supported by the Windows TCP/IP provider. If this option is used on Windows Vista and later, the getsockopt and setsockopt functions fail with WSAEINVAL. On earlier versions of Windows, these functions fail with WSAENOPROTOOPT.|
